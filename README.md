# To-do List
## üí° Project
This project is a simple to-do list to help you stay organized and on top of what you need to do!<br/>
I developed this in order to practice my Typescript, React, Javascript knowledge and to make it useful to other people by adding their own tasks<br/>
and visualize them to keep a organized routine.
